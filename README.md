RSI-Assist
=========

RSI-Assist is a Chrome browser extension intended to assist people suffering from Repetitive Stress Injury.

The extension provides word suggestions to users as they type, a functionality similar to the word suggestion features on smartphones. Five suggestions are displayed below the user's cursor and are numbered 1 to 5. The user can select the word they wish to insert by pressing the suggestion's corresponding number.

This extension is not intended to increase the user's input speed but rather to reduce the user's number of keystrokes.

This program was created for a good friend who suffers from RSI.
